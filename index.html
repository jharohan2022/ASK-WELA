                    Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally,
                    accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer
                    program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms'
                    accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen
                    programming language, commonly referred to as coding).The source code of a program is written
                    in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is
                    directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequenc
                    usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application
                    domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
